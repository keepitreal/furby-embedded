# Audio Device Lock Fix Summary

## The Problem

The Furby server was causing **persistent audio device locks** that could only be resolved by rebooting the Raspberry Pi. This happened because:

1. **Multiple PyAudio instances** were competing for the same audio device:

   - `WakeWordDetector` created its own PyAudio instance
   - `AudioManager` created its own PyAudio instance
   - Each opened streams with different configurations

2. **Continuous audio streams** were kept open:

   - Wake word detector ran a continuous 48000 Hz stereo stream
   - When the server shut down, cleanup race conditions left streams open
   - The device became locked at kernel level

3. **Improper cleanup order** caused resource leaks:
   - Multiple PyAudio instances weren't properly coordinated
   - Stream cleanup happened in separate threads
   - PyAudio termination wasn't synchronized

## The Solution

### 1. Shared Audio Manager (`shared_audio_manager.py`)

Created a **singleton shared audio manager** that:

- Uses a single PyAudio instance for all audio operations
- Manages all audio streams with unique IDs
- Provides thread-safe stream creation and cleanup
- Ensures proper resource cleanup on shutdown

**Key Features:**

- Thread-safe stream management with locks
- Automatic device index configuration
- Centralized cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Singleton pattern ensures only one PyAudio instance

### 2. Updated Components

**WakeWordDetector:**

- Now uses `SharedAudioManager` instead of creating its own PyAudio instance
- Streams are managed through shared audio manager
- Proper cleanup through shared manager prevents device locks

**AudioManager:**

- Updated to use `SharedAudioManager`
- Recording streams are managed centrally
- Simplified cleanup as shared manager handles PyAudio termination

**FurbyServer:**

- Improved cleanup order: wake word detector → audio manager → shared audio manager
- Ensures all resources are properly released

### 3. Test Scripts

Created comprehensive test scripts to verify the fix:

**`test_shared_audio.py`:**

- Tests basic shared audio manager functionality
- Verifies proper stream creation and cleanup
- Tests multiple concurrent streams

**`test_full_audio_system.py`:**

- Simulates complete Furby audio pipeline
- Tests wake word detection + audio recording
- Includes rapid start/stop testing
- Verifies proper cleanup after complex operations

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Run the test scripts first:**

   ```bash
   python3 test_shared_audio.py
   python3 test_full_audio_system.py
   ```

2. **Test the actual server:**

   ```bash
   python3 furby_server.py
   # Let it run for a bit, then Ctrl+C
   ```

3. **Verify audio works after shutdown:**
   ```bash
   aplay -D hw:0,0 ../WM8960_Audio_HAT_Code/music_48k.wav
   ```

## Technical Details

### Before (Problem):

```
WakeWordDetector:
├── PyAudio instance #1
├── Continuous stream (48000Hz stereo)
└── Cleanup in separate thread

AudioManager:
├── PyAudio instance #2
├── Temporary streams (16000Hz mono)
└── Cleanup in main thread

Result: Race conditions, device locks, kernel-level corruption
```

### After (Fixed):

```
SharedAudioManager (Singleton):
├── Single PyAudio instance
├── Stream registry with IDs
├── Thread-safe operations
└── Coordinated cleanup

WakeWordDetector → uses SharedAudioManager
AudioManager → uses SharedAudioManager
FurbyServer → coordinates cleanup order

Result: Proper resource cleanup, no device locks
```

## Benefits

1. **No more device locks** - single PyAudio instance prevents conflicts
2. **Reliable cleanup** - centralized resource management
3. **Thread safety** - proper synchronization prevents race conditions
4. **Better error handling** - comprehensive cleanup on failures
5. **Easier debugging** - centralized audio management

## Files Modified

- `shared_audio_manager.py` - **NEW**: Singleton shared audio manager
- `wake_word_detector.py` - Updated to use shared manager
- `audio_manager.py` - Updated to use shared manager
- `furby_server.py` - Improved cleanup order
- `test_shared_audio.py` - **NEW**: Test script for shared manager
- `test_full_audio_system.py` - **NEW**: Full system test

## Verification

The fix is successful if:

- ✅ Test scripts run without errors
- ✅ `aplay` works immediately after server shutdown
- ✅ No need to reboot between server runs
- ✅ Audio playback works correctly after multiple server starts/stops

This eliminates the need for rebooting to fix audio after running the Furby server.
